                          <span>2021 - 2023 (2 Years)</span>
                          <p>Designed and developed a HoloLens 2 Mixed Reality application that provides gait training for patients with gait disorders.</p>
                          <ul class="list-style-one">
                              <li>The application analyzes the environment around the user and spawns an avatar that can intelligently navigate around the environment. When the user follows the avatar, the system analyzes the user's walking pattern and assigned a score. Based on the score, it can early identify neural and motor-related disorders and also can help the user with gait training.</li>
                              <li>This project is a massive collaborative project with multiple departments including medical science, biomechanics, and computer science with over millions of funding (Award Number: P20GM109090)</li>
                              <li>Translated and optimized algorithms written in Matlab to C# and evaluate the accuracy.</li>
